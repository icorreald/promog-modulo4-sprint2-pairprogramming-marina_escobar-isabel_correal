0,Fortnight,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me

I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic

All of this to say I hope you're okay

But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you


[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him"
1,The Tortured Poets Department,"[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment

Straight from the tortured poets department

I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""

But you're in self-sabotage mode

Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show

Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""

And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate

We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist

I scratch your head, you fall asleep

Like a tattooed golden retriever

But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head

But I've read this one where you come undone

I chose this cyclone with you"
2,My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,"[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild

The sickest army doll

Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile


[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh

'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night

I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've playеd for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating mysеlf

Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string

And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)"
3,Down Bad,"[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up

In a cloud of sparkling dust

Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym

Everything comes out teenage petulance

""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up

Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay


[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him"
4,"So Long, London","[Intro]
So (So), long (Long), London (London)
So (So), long (Long), London (London)
So (So), long (Long), London (London)


[Verse 1]
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist

I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift

Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill

Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh,
stopped tryna drill the safe

[Chorus]
Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone


[Verse 2]
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about

I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath

I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to

And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free"
5,But Daddy I Love Him,"[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun

I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you

Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best

Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse for a simple girl
To rise above it

They slammed the door on my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him

I'm havin' his baby""

No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses

I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid

Tendrils tucked into a woven braid

Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all

He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy

Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall"
6,Fresh Out The Slammer,"[Intro]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you

Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to

(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder

He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter
, silent dinners, bitter

He was with her in dreams


[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels

Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine

Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you

Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again"
7,Florida!!!,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too

They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies

And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in

So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share
down in Destin


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]
Florida
Is one hell of a drug
Florida
Can I use you up?


[Verse 2: Florence Welch]
The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away

Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine

Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine

All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here"
8,Guilty as Sin?,"[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while

My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine

Am I allowed to cry?

I dream of crackin' locks

Throwin' my life to the wolves
or the ocean rocks

Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?


[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine
"" on my upper thigh
only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze

Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did

Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts

Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault

Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""

These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me

We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe

Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?"
9,Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,"[Verse 1]
The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack

But my bare hands paved their paths

You don't get to tell me about ""sad""


[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street

Crash the party like a record scratch
as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""

You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed

At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke

Then we could all just laugh until I cry


[Chorus]
So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""

I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""

Who's afraid of little old me
?
Well, you should be"
10,I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),"[Verse 1]
The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town

The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud


[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can

[Verse 2]
The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway

His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face

And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set

He had a halo of the highest gradе
He just hadn't met me yеt


[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can

And only I can"
11,loml,"[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames

If we know the steps anyway
?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away

Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""

I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""

I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed

I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since


[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary

You and I go from one kiss to getting married

Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried

In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy

You Holy Ghost
, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life

About a million times


[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate

And told me I reformed you?

When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes

Well, you took me to hell too

And all at once, the ink bleeds

A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme

But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since"
12,I Can Do It With A Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
I can read your mind

""She's having the time of her life""

There in her glittering prime

The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night

I can show you lies

(One, two, three, four)


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid

I can handle my shit

They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did

Lights, camera, bitch, smile

Even when you wanna die

He said he'd love me all his life

But that life was too short

Breaking down, I hit the floor

All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting
, ""More""

I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'

I was hittin' my marks

'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

(One, two, three, four)


[Chorus]

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day

I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague

I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art

You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart"
13,The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,"[Verse 1]
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed

In your Jehovah's Witness suit

Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine

They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal

And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins

In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man"
14,The Alchemy,"[Verse 1]
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag

Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong


[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?


[Verse 2]
Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong"
15,Clara Bow,"[Verse 1]
""You look like Clara Bow

In this light, remarkable

All your life, did you know

You'd be picked like a rose?""


[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened

Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan""


[Chorus]
""This town is fake, but you're the real thing

Breath of fresh air through smoke rings

Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling""


[Verse 2]
""You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips

Crowd goes wild at her fingertips

Half moonshine, a full еclipse""


[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggeratе
But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.

They all wanna say..."""
16,The Black Dog,"[Verse 1]
I am someone who until recent events
You shared your secre
ts with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off

And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog

And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off

And it hits me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""

And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song

That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming

Old habits die screaming


[Verse 2]
I move through the world with the heartbroken

My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up thе way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans

You said I needed a bravе man
Then proceeded to play him

Until I believed it too
And it kills me"
17,imgonnagetyouback,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
Did your research, you knew the price goin' in
And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet

But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet

But I'm gonna get you back

[Post-Chorus]
I, I hear thе whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
(You're mine)

[Verse 2]
Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end"
18,The Albatross,"[Verse 1]
Wise men once said
""Wild winds are death to the candle""

A rose by any other name is a scandal

Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers
They tried to warn him about her

[Chorus]
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you

She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you


[Verse 2]
Wise men once said
""One bad seed kills the garden""
""One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen""
Locked me up in towers
But I'd visit in your dreams
And they tried to warn you about me

[Chorus]
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross

She is here to destroy you
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger

She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger"
19,Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus,"[Verse 1]

Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness

Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus

And I just watched it happen

As the decade would play us for fools

And you saw my bones out with somebody new

Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school

And you just watched it happen

[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""

If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered


[Verse 2]
You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts

You needed me, but you needed drugs more

And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools

Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules

All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it"
20,How Did it End?,"[Intro]
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem

He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman

Our maladies were such we could not cure them

And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign


[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again

The empathetic hunger descends

We'll tell no one except all of our friends

We must know
How did it end?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs

And fell victim to interlopers' glances

Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?

Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins"
21,So High School,"[Intro]
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you


[Chorus]
And in a blink of a crinklin' eye

I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights

Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time

Bittersweet sixteen suddenly


[Post-Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm trying to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Are you gonna marry, kiss or kill me? (Kill me)

It's just a game, but really (Really)
I'm bettin' on all three for us two (All three)
Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)

Then pull me to thе backseat (The backseat)
No onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you"
22,I Hate it Here,"[Verse 1]
Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet
trapped inside the body of a finance guy

Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize

You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside

If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck

Now that I know what's what

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind

People need a key to get to
, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child

No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Verse 2]
My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists

And getting married off for the highest bid

Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it

It was freezing in the palace"
23,thanK you aiMee,"[Verse 1]
When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you

And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school


[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal


[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill
each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave

And then she wrotе headlines

In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say"
24,I Look in Peoples Windows,"[Verse 1]
I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath

Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south

[Pre-Chorus]
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing so

[Chorus]
I look in people's windows

Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time

[Verse 2]
You had stopped and tiltеd your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I triеd searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown"
25,The Prophecy,"[Verse 1]
Hand on the throttle

Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
Oh, but it's gone again
And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten

Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home

I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said

[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees

Change the prophecy

Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company

Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?

[Verse 2]
Cards on thе table
Mine play out like fools in a fablе

Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
Slow is the quicksand
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
Oh, still I dream of him"
26,Cassandra,"[Verse 1]
I was in my new house placing daydreams

Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying

'Cause that's where I was when I got the call


[Pre-Chorus]
When the first stone's thrown
, there's screamin'
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's ""Burn the bitch,
"" they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet


[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst

And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say

Do you believe me now?


[Verse 2]
I was in my tower weaving nightmares

Twisting all my smiles into snarls

They say, ""What doesn't kill you makes you aware""

What happens if it becomes who you are?


[Chorus]
So, they killed
Cassandra
first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town

So they set my life in flames
, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?"
27,Peter,"[Verse 1]
Forgive me, Peter

My lost fearless leader

In closets like cedar

Preserved from when we were just kids
Is it somethin' I did?
The goddess of timing

Once found us beguiling
She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Thеn you were gonna come find mе
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me

Words from the mouths of babes

Promises oceans deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep"
28,The Bolter,"[Verse 1]
By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed

And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""


[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing


[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice

Then came out alive"
29,Robin,"[Verse 1]
Long may you reign

You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense

You have no idea


[Pre-Chorus]
Strings tied to levers

Slowed-down clocks tethered

All this showmanship

To keep it for you in sweetness


[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger

Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you


[Verse 2]
Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous

And you have no idea

[Pre-Chorus]
Buried down deep
And out of your reach
The secret we all vowed

To keep it from you in sweetness"
30,The Manuscript,"[Verse 1]
Now and then she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair

They compared their licenses
He said, ""I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it""

She rolled her eyes and said
""You're a professional""

He said, ""No, just a good samaritan""
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon they'd be pushin' strollers
But soon it was over

[Verse 2]
In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press

Afterwards she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in
her mother's
bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors

She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure


[Bridge]
And the years passed
Like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards

Might be the only way to move forward

Then the actors
Were hitting their marks

And the slow dance
Was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell
In synchronicity with the score
And at last
She knew what the agony had been for"
