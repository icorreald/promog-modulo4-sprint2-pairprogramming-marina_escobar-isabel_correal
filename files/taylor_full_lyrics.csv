All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold  But something 'bout it felt like home somehow  And I left my scarf there at your sister's house  And you've still got it in your drawer, even now  Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze  We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate  Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  And I can picture it after all these days  And I know it's long gone and  That magic's not here no more  And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all  Oh, oh, oh  'Causе there we arе again on that little town street  You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me  Wind in my hair, I was there  I remember it all too well  Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red  You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed  And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team  You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me  And I know it's long gone and  There was nothing else I could do  And I forget about you long enough  To forget why I needed to  'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night  We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light  Down the stairs, I was there  I remember it all too well, yeah  And maybe we got lost in translation  Maybe I asked for too much  But maybe this thing was a masterpiece  'Til you tore it all up  Running scared, I was there  I remember it all too well  And you call me up again  Just to break me like a promise  So casually cruel in the name of being honest  I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  'Cause I remember it all, all, all  Too well  Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it  I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it  After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  You can't get rid of it  'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah  'Cause there we are again when I loved you so  Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  It was rare, I was there  I remember it all too well  Wind in my hair, you were there  You remember it all  Down the stairs, you were there  You remember it all  It was rare, I was there"
Begin Again (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"Took a deep breath in the mirror  He didn't like it when I wore high heels  But I do  Turn the lock and put my headphones on  He always said he didn't get this song  But I do, I do  I walked in, expecting you'd be late  But you got here early and you stand and wave  I walk to you  You pull my chair out and help me in  And you don't know how nice that is  But I do  And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid  I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did  I've been spending the last eight months  Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end  But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again  You said you nеver met one girl who  Had as many James Taylor records as you  But I do  We tell stories and you don't know why  I'm coming off a little shy  But I do  But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid  I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did  Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end  But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again  And we walked down the block to my car  And I almost brought him up  But you start to talk about the movies  That your family watches every single Christmas  And I want to talk about that  And for the first time, what's past is past  'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid  I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did  On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"
Come Back...Be Here (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"You said it in a simple way  4 AM, the second day  How strange that I don't know you at all  Stumbled through the long goodbye  One last kiss, then catch your flight  Right when I was just about to fall  I told myself, ""Don't get attached""  But in my mind, I play it back  Spinning faster than the plane that took you  And this is when the feeling sinks in  I don't wanna miss you like this  Come back, be here, come back, be here  I guess you're in New York today  I don't wanna need you this way  Come back, be here, come back, be here  The delicate beginning rush  The feeling you can know so much  Without knowing anything at all  And now that I can put this down  If I had known what I know now  I never would've played so nonchalant  Taxi cabs and busy streets  That never bring you back to me  I can't help but wish you took me with you  Come back, be here, come back, be here  I guess you're in London today  And I don't wanna need you this way  Come back, be here, come back, be here  Oh-oh, oh-oh  Oh-oh, oh-oh  Oh-oh, oh-oh  This is falling in love in the cruelest way  This is falling for you when you are worlds away  In New York, be here  But you're in London, and I break down  'Cause it's not fair that you're not around  This is when the feeling sinks in  I don't wanna miss you like this  I guess you're in New York today  And I don't wanna need you this way  Oh-oh, oh-oh  I don't wanna miss you like this  Oh-oh, oh-oh  Come back, be here  Come back, be here"

Holy Ground (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"I was reminiscing just the other day  While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away  Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time  Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme  Took off faster than a green light, go  Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know  I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made  And that was the first day  And darling, it was good  Never looking down  And right there where we stood  Was holy ground  Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress  We had this big, wide city all to ourselves  Wе block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""  And for thе first time, I had something to lose  And I guess we fell apart in the usual way  And the story's got dust on every page  But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now  And I see your face in every crowd  'Cause darling, it was good  Never looking down  Tonight I'm gonna dance  For all that we've been through  But I don't wanna dance  If I'm not dancing with you  Tonight I'm gonna dance  Like you were in this room  But I don't wanna dance  If I'm not dancing with you  It was good  Never looking down"

Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say  About a beautiful boy who died  And it's about to be Halloween  You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  I remember the last day, when I kissed your face  And whispered in your ear  We're going to fly away from here  Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray  We'll just disappear  Come on, baby, with me  We're going to fly away from here  What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?  And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?  And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?  What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh, oh  It was a few years later, I showed up here  And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared  How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out  They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere  Chose the rose garden over Madison Square  And it took some time, but I understand it now  'Cause now my name is up in lights  But I think you got it right  Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh  Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh"
The Moment I Knew (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"You should've been there  Should've burst through the door  With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile  And it would've felt like  A million little shining stars that just align  And I would've been so happy  Christmas lights glisten  I've got my eye on the door  Just waiting for you to walk in  But the time is ticking  People ask me how I've been  As I comb back through my memory  How you said you'd be here  You said you'd be here  And it was like slow motion  Standing there in my party dress  In red lipstick  With no one to impress  And they're all laughing  As I'm looking around the room  But therе was one thing missing  And that was the moment I knеw  And the hours pass by  Now I just wanna be alone  But your close friends always seem to know  When there's something really wrong  So they follow me down the hall  And there in the bathroom  I try not to fall apart  And the sinking feeling starts  As I say hopelessly  ""He said he'd be here""  And they're all laughing  And asking me about you  But there was one thing missing  And that was the moment I knew  What do you say  When tears are streaming down your face  In front of everyone you know?  And what do you do  When the one who means the most to you  Is the one who didn't show?  You should've been here  And I would've been so happy  With no one to impress  And they're all standing around me, singing  ""Happy birthday to you""  But there was one thing missing  And that was the moment I knew  Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew  Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  You called me later  And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""  And I said, ""I'm sorry, too""  And that was the moment I knew"
Treacherous (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"Put your lips close to mine  As long as they don't touch  Out of focus, eye to eye  'Til the gravity's too much  And I'll do anything you say  If you say it with your hands  And I'd be smart to walk away  But you're quicksand  This slope is treacherous  This path is reckless  This slope is treacherous  And I-I-I like it  I can't decide if it's a choice  Getting swept away  I hear the sound of my own voice  Asking you to stay  All we are is skin and bone  Trained to get along  Forever going with the flow  But you're friction  This slope is treacherous  I-I-I like it  Two headlights shine through the sleepless night  And I will get you a, get you alone  Your name has echoed through my mind  And I just think you should, think you should know  That nothing safe is worth the drive  And I would follow you, follow you home  I'll follow you, follow you home  This hope is treacherous  This daydream is dangerous  This hope is treacherous  I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I -  That nothing safe is worth the drive  And I will follow you, follow you home  I'll follow you, follow you home  I'll follow you, follow you home  I'll follow you, follow you home  This slope is treacherous"
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor’s Version),"I remember when we broke up  The first time, sayin', ""This is it, I've had enough""  'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month  When you said you needed space (What?)

If This Was a Movie,Speak Now (Deluxe),"Last night, I heard my own heart beating  Sounded like footsteps on my stairs  Six months gone and I'm still reaching  Even though I know you're not there  I was playing back a thousand memories, baby  Thinking 'bout everything we've been through  Maybe I've been going back too much lately  When time stood still and I had you  Come back, come back, come back to me like  You would, you would if this was a movie  Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out  Come back, come back, come back to me like  You could, you could if you just said you're sorry  I know that we could work it out somehow  But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now  I know people change and these things happen  But I remember how it was back then  Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'  'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them  Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street  Flashback to the night when you said to me  That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you  Back before I knew how much I had to lose  I know that we could work it out somehow  But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on  I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone  I just want it back the way it was before  And I just want to see you back at my front door  And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like  You would before you said it's not that easy  Before the fight, before I locked you out  But I take it all back now""  You'd be here by now  It's not the kind of ending you want to see now  Baby, what about the ending?  Oh, I thought you'd be here by now  Oh, oh  Thought you'd be here by now"
Ours,Speak Now (Deluxe),"Elevator buttons and morning air  Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs  If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares  But right now, my time is theirs  Seems like there's always someone who disapproves  They'll judge it like they know about me and you  And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do  The jury's out, but my choice is you  So don't you worry your pretty little mind  People throw rocks at things that shine  And life makes love look hard  The stakes are high, the water's rough  But this love is ours  You never know what people have up their sleeves  Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me  Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles  But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine  And you'll say  Don't you worry your pretty little mind  People throw rocks at things that shine  And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and  Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and  I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you  'Cause I love the gap between your teeth  And I love the riddles that you speak  And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos  Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours  And life makes love look hard  Don't you worry your pretty little mind  People throw rocks at things that shine  But they can't take what's ours  They can't take what's ours  The stakes are high, the water's rough"
Superman,Speak Now (Deluxe),"Tall, dark, and superman  He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away  To save the world or go to work  It's the same thing to me  He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition  I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him  I hang on every word you say, yay  And you smile and say, ""How are you?""  I say, ""Just fine""  I always forget to tell you, I love you  I love you forever  I watch superman fly away  You've got a busy day today  Go save the world, I'll be around  I watch superman fly away  Come back, I'll be with you someday  I'll be right here on the ground  When you come back down  Tall, dark and beautiful  He's complicated, he's irrational  But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah  Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'  He's not all bad like his reputation  And I can't hear one single word they say  And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay  I always forget to tell you I love you  I loved you from the very first day  And I watch you fly around the world  And I hope you don't save some other girl  Don't forget, don't forget about me  I'm far away, but I never let you go  I'm love-struck and looking out the window  Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be  Right here, wishing the flowers were from you  Wishing the card was from you  Wishing the call was from you  'Cause I loved you from the very first day  Go save the world, I'll be around  Forever and ever here  I watch superman fly away  I swear, I'll be with you someday  I'll be right here on the ground  La, la, la, la, la, la  La, la, la, la, la, la  When you come back down"
the lakes,folklore (deluxe version),"Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?  I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones  These hunters with cell phones  Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die  I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you  Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry  I'm setting off, but not without my muse  What should be over burrowed under my skin  In heart-stopping waves of hurt  I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze  Tell me what are my words worth  I want auroras and sad prose  I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet  'Cause I haven't moved in years  And I want you right here  A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground  With no one around to tweet it  While I bathe in cliffside pools  With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief  I'm setting off, but not without my muse  No, not without you"
